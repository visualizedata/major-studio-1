Create a new environment using all the default settings, then clone this repo by running `git clone https://github.com/visualizedata/major-studio-1.git`.

##### Completing the exercises

Open the `exercises` directory and work through the exercises.

##### Saving your work

Before this class, you should have already created a Github repo for Major Studio 1. Navigate to your local directory, save and commit your local work, then check if you have a remote set for the local repo with `git remote -v`.

If it doesn't show a remote origin like this:
```
origin  https://github.com/user/repo.git (fetch)
origin  https://github.com/user/repo.git (push)
```
To add a remote URL, use `git add origin https://github.com/user/repo.git`, substituting in your `user` and `repo` in the URL. 

To update an existing remote url to use your personal access token, use `git remote set-url origin https://myToken@github.com/myGithubID/myReopName.git/`

For more information on creating personal access tokens, take a look at [this document](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token).
